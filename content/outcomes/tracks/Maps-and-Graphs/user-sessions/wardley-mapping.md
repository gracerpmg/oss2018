## Outcomes

## Synopsis and Takeaways 

Value Chain Mapping is used for all manner of initiatives; to aid corporate strategy development, to aid organizational development, to writing Sci-Fi books, to developing huge engineering projects, or to gain situational awareness.

- Simon Wardley gave a very engaging on his system of mapping value chains in order to get a clearer picture of a situation and from that map, develop a strategy.

## Identified Questions

- To channel group energy, he presented a scenario where each table acted as a board who had to make a decision on the direction a subsidiary should take.
The four tables came up with various solutions - Table C alone suggested divesting.  The real-life result was different again, proving Simon's point that a lot of what happens in business is "alchemy".  Everyone read the pages differently, and drew different conclusions from the story/scenario he presented. 

That is, until, he started to explain his maps and how they provide a picture of the situation as it is, thus making it easier to develop a strategy. 

A recurring theme was the reluctance of many business leaders o be the first one to adopt something new; however, they will change if they are presented with the proof that "many", "most" or "X%" are doing whatever it is.  Moving to the cloud is one such example.

Mapping the story removed the possibility for interpretation - the map is the story and there can be no deviation from it. 

Wardley maps are divided in four:
  - Genesis
  - Custom Built
  - Product 
  - Commodity
  
  Before having a department spend valuable time and resources on developing something (genesis/custom built), companies would be better-served if they shopped around to see what is available off-the-shelf (product/commodity).
  
  People work in these four areas as 
  - Pioneers (genesis)
  - Settlers (custom-built)
  - Town Planners (product/commodity)
  
  These roles are not exclusive, and one can act as one or other at any particular time. 
  
  ## Important Conclusions
  
  At a certain point in their development, companies can reach what Wardly calls "inertia" - they have reached a point of success and cannot think beyond it - Blockbuster refusing to go into a partnership with Netflix is one such example.  Nokia's rejection of the smartphone is another.  The companies ultimately suffer, and often fail. 
  
  Wardley also pointed out that it is difficult to predict what is going to succeed - things develop over time and create extra value.
  
  With Wardley Maps, however, allow us to visualise priorities.  
  
  There are several videos on YouTube with versions of Simon Wardley's most enjoyable and engaging presentation.
